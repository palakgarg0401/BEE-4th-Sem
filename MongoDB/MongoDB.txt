Databases  
    |
Collections
    |
Documents

Advantage -> NoSql is easy to scale and to implement
Drawback -> There is no schema 

MongoShell -> Command Line Interface
    |
    |-> mongosh (command) to check the MongoShell

To check the databases present in the MongoDB -> show dbs
To swtch between databases we use -> use db_name (command)
If database is not present new database will be created -> use db_name (command)
Same for collections...

For inserting documents -> db.collection_name.(query)insertOne({document_name}) (for single) 
                           db.collection_name.(query)insertMany({document_name}) (for multiple)

db.collection_name.find() (to find all the document)
for specific condition -> we have to pass filter conditions
db.collection_name.find({age:{$gt:18}})
