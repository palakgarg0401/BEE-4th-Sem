CSR -> Client Side Rendering
SSR -> Server Side Rendering

CSR -> client send request to server through api to view the frontend files
files render on browser (waterfall requests)

SSR -> 
files are render by browser

more load on server (disadvantage)
to run file on server or perform server side rendering we need third party template engine (e.g. ejs, hbs{handlBars})

search engine optimization
off side using links which are displayed ranking is done
on side using keyboards
